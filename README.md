#PRODIGY_DS_01

###Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.


##INTRODUCTION

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers who sailed on the RMS Titanic.The dataset is a commonly used example of a binary classification issue, in which it is necessary to determine, in light of multiple variables, the probability that a passenger survived.


##DATASET

The given titanic csv.csv dataset  contains 21 rows, each representing a passenger, and 18 columns:

- Passenger_No: Passenger's number
- first_ame: The passenger's first name
- last_name: The passenger's last name
- survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
- pclass: The passenger's class (1, 2, or 3)
- sex: The passenger's sex (male or female)
- age: The passenger's age
- parch: The number of parents/children aboard
- fare: The fare paid
- embarked: The port of embarkation (C, Q, or S)
- class: The class in which passengers belongs to (First,Second or Third)
- who:The passenger is man, woman or child
- adult_male:Whether the passenger is adult male (TRUE) or not adult_male (FALSE)
- deck:The passenger's deck(A,B,C,D,E or G)
- embarked_town: The town of embarkation (Southampton, Cherbourg or Queenstown)
- alive:Whether the passenger  are alive(yes) or not (no)
- alone:The passenger's are alone or not
- DECK_NUMBER:The passenger's deck number(60,70,80,90 or 100)


##CONCLUSION

The visualization of different categorical values in the Titanic dataset has provided valuable insights into the factors that affected the survival rate of passengers. Specifically, the analysis has shown that younger people, females, and those in the Upper class were more likely to survive the disaster.
